A fully connected multi-layer neural network is called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It has 3 layers including one hidden layer. If it has more than 1 hidden layer,
it is called a deep ANN.
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected feed-forward artificial neural network with at least three layers (input, output, and at least one hidden layer)
MLP is in general a layered feed-forward network, pictorially represented with a directed acyclic graph as shown in Fig 2. Each node in the graph represents an artificial neuron of the MLP, and each directed arc represents a synaptic connection between two neurons and the direction of the signal flow in the MLP.
